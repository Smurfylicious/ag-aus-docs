The Steam group is at: [steamcommunity.com/groups/AG-Aus](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AG-Aus).

All Staff have mod/admin access to the group (SteamCommunity.com distinguishes still between the original group owner and other staff in ultimate rights).

The profile info should at all times include details about:

- the AG community, including a note regarding being a LGBTQI space
- our rules
- IP addresses for all servers

<small>No real need to edit this stuff unless something new and fairly permanent needs to get added.</small>

## Use of notifications

We want to remain consistent amongst announcements and event listings. Thus:

- **Announcements** are for important information and reminders that need to be sent out to everyone. Remember: anyone who is a member of the group will get a popup if you post an announcement. Think twice before posting!
- **Events** are for specific events on specific servers. It doesn’t really matter when you set up the event as group members will receive a popup both when it’s scheduled and when it starts. If you want to host an impromptu event that’s fine — use event listings instead of announcements.

**Player of the Week** should be chosen every week or so, but should only be given to those deserving of awesomeness.
