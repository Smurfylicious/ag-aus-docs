[SourceMod](http://www.sourcemod.net) is an open source plugin (Metamod:Source plugin) for the Source engine, providing a customisable scripting platform for handling server customisations and administration/moderation. The base install comes bundled with some main plugins, with many more shared.

## Admin/mod commands

Besides using the inbuilt admin menu (`!admin`) in the in-game chat staff/mods can access admin commands via in-game chat directly, e.g.:

    !ban troublemaker

Commands can be surpressed from the console output/chat dialogue using `/` instead of `!`.

For a full list of commands and selector/targetting syntax see the [SourceMod admin commands wiki page](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Admin_commands_(sourcemod)) from AlliedMods.
