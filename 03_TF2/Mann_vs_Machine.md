With help from Plodski and Disturbed we ran a fourth server in [Mann vs Machine mode](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Mann_vs._Machine).

## Switching to–fro MvM mode

Switching between MvM mode and other gameplay modes is fairly simple — it works similarly as switching to/from Arena mode. Thus, just switch map to a non-MvM map (and remember to switch back to a MvM map when the custom event concludes).

Be wary: the default maps have not changed — all map lists and cycles on Server #4 contain only MvM maps and custom maps as needed for events. Only staff/mods can switch to these non-MvM maps. For more info see [§ Maps](#).

The server also hosts multiple `server.cfg` files: *`server_32slot.cfg`* and *`server_mvm.cfg`* in `/tf/cfg/` respectively need to be copied and renamed to `server.cfg` (then restart the server).
