Patches to the TF2 server are issued by Valve regularly, usually arriving AEST early Friday. Each TF2 server must be updated individually via the [PantheonES Dashboard](http://gp.pantheones.com.au/):

1. log into the dashboard
2. select server
3. top-right, select “Update Game” — this spawns a new window
4. go through the update process
5. notify others that servers have been patched via staff/mod forums

**Note:**

- Updating restarts the server.
- Please remember to post server(s) & date updated to let other staff/mods know.
