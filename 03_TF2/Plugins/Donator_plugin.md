Donations are handled by ______ plugin.

## Automation baby!

!to come

## Coniguration files

- `/tf/addons/sourcemod/data/donators.txt`
- `/tf/addons/sourcemod/configs/admins.cfg`

When adding donators you’ll need to add them to both files — this needs to be done for all servers. With regards to syntax, just follow the syntax used for the other existing donator entries.

Also, just quickly check that the person you’re adding hasn’t already got an entry that’s been commented out. If that’s the case just remove the comments at the start of those lines and update the expiry date.
