* What: gibbing peeps in TF2 while rocking out to shared tunes via [HLDJ](http://www.hldj.org/)
* Where: Server #4
* When: Saturday nights, 21:00 AEST–midnight

## Running the event

Provided [HLDJ is all set up](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AG-Aus/discussions/0/846939071172533499/), running a Juke Box night is simple:

1. Post event notice on Steam group (see below)
2. Switch Server #4 from MvM mode by switching to your desired non-MvM map
3. Run event
4. Switch config back to MvM (map change to a MvM map)

Make your event announcement catchy:

---

> Come, sing, dance. Requests welcome — come join and gib people alongside your favourite tunes.

### Extra DJs

This event is simple to organise, but blossoms with the help of a couple of extra DJs. The folks with tunes who can lend a hand:

* Dave Ruck
* Devil
* Daria (Jigglebones)
* FLASH
* TehStoneMan
