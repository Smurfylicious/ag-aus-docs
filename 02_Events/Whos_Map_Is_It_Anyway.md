* What: community map testing
* Where: Server #3 - *Apeture Test Chamber*
* When: …

This event seeks to test maps for playbility, balance, and glitches, firstly to assess if we want to offer them on Server #1. Secondarily play-testing can lead to useful criticism and debugging for map makers.

Generally this is an invite-only event, as the server will be password protected.

## Running the event

As these are typically invite-only events think about players early! We want folks who don’t dick around and offer constructive criticism. Players with map making and game experience may take precedence.

Otherwise running *Whose Map Is It Anyway* is fairly simple:

1. Chose a few maps that you and/or the commnunity is keen on testing.
2. Password-protect server #3 (via `sv_password`)
3. Invite players and share the password.
4. Play test!
5. If applicable keep track of anything noteworthy to pass up to map devs.

## Collating and giving feedback

Chances are that during testing you may come across things that are worth passing all the way back to the map developer(s). Maps are shared and hosted across a variety of places, so sometimes hunting down the original maker(s) can be difficult — don’t rely on mirrors to provide authentic author info.

[TF2Maps.net](http://tf2maps.net/) is a good resource for maps and has community of testers around it, in particular their [*Tutorials & Resources*](http://forums.tf2maps.net/forumdisplay.php?f=57) subforum.

We may investigate contacting and using [the feedback plugin that TF2Maps are using](http://forums.tf2maps.net/showthread.php?t=18871) which allows players to write annotations on maps while in-game, both generally and as location-specific feedback (tracks player location and view).
