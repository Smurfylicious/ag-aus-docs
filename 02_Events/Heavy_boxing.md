* What: boxing with Heavies
* Where: Server #1
* When: 1st of March, June, September and December

## Running the event

Running a Heavy Boxing match is fairly straightforward.

First, post up an event notice on the Steam group ~3–4 days prior to the event itself, e.g.:

---

> The 1st day of Autumn will be celebrated, not with dancing naked under a full moon in fields of tall grass, but with big Russian men punching the crap out of each other!
>
Only AG members are elligible to play in the match — registration before any bouts start is a must. Umpires decision is final. Prizes go to winner and runner-up.
>
> Come along and smack some people (BYO gloves and/or trouts).

### Server config

- map length needs to be extended to 60 minutes (via `mp_timelimit 60`)
- friendly-fire must be enabled (via `mp_friendlyfire 0`/`1`)
- random weapon ciritcals must be disabled (via `tf_weapon_criticals 0`/`1`)
- weapons need to be restricted to melee—ahem, big fist in bad-guy face (via `tf_weapon_fists`)

### Game format/rules

- umpires shouldn’t play themselves
- preferably two staff/mod members should be present (one umpire; one for the server generally)
- games are to be played 1v1, with sudden death rounds until one boxer remains

**Remember:** please switch any configuration you’ve changed back once everything is finished.

## Alternative mode

HEAVY WEIGHT BOXER OF THE UNIVERSE & IT'S INFINITE REALITIES!!!

Additionally to the above server changes, player colours need to be grouped. !expand section

This mode is a yearly, round-robbin competition, featuring four groups of 4 (each a different colour) fighting each other group once each in best of three: 3 points for win, 1 point for loss. (In the rare event of a draw: 2 points each.) Bonus point given for spectacular events, come-backs or similar, at the umpire’s discretion. (Only 1 bonus per player per match given).

Top boxer from each group form final series (change group colour here maybe?). Each fight continues as in last round-robbin. Points awarded accordingly.

## Prizes

Prizes change on availability, but typically have included:

* an unusual hat
* rare items
* paints/keys or other stocking stuffer's
* a couple weapons (generally vintage if possible)
