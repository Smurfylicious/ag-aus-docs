### AG Raffles Account

To make raffles easier to organise between staff/mod we have a separate Steam account holding items to be used for raffles (`ag_raffles`). This account should be the recipient of donations from our community for prize pools.

This account is not for crafting or storing personal items — it is only to store items that have been donated to AG solely for prizes. Other than renaming the account handle to specify which staffer/mod member is currently using the account (e.g. `AG Raffles (staffname)`) **do not change the settings on this account.**

Please do encourage members to join the friend list of this account — it makes receiving donations a lot easier.

To access this account you will need to logout of your personal Steam account and re-log using the account credentials. (If you haven’t signed in before on that machine it’s likely you’ll have to provide two-factor authentication via the corresponding Steam email account.)

## Using TF2R.com

Head over to [TF2R.com](http://tf2r.com/) and sign in to the AG Raffles account on the TF2R.com site via the inbuilt Steam logon ([Valve offer OpenID via their API](http://steamcommunity.com/dev) for authenticating Steam credentials w/o disclosing them to third parties).

### Configuring a raffle

Once signed-in on TF2R.com select “New Raffle” and the signed-in Steam account’s TF2 backpack will appear. Select the items that are to be raffled off this raffle (clicking items adds from the backpack adds them; clicking them again in the selected items tray removes them). See below re. which items to raffle.

Give the raffle a name, a max entries of 32 people, and a duration ranging from 5–15 miutes, depending on circumstances/mood on the server. No referrral filter is needed.

Of the 4 radio buttons at the bottom left the only one you will need to change is the to select *All items to one person, viz., one and only one winner per raffle.

### Items to raffle

As a guide, select goods to raffle, as follows, with all going to 1 winner:

- Standard weapons, in groups of 6,  the "Reclaimed Raffle"
- Strange weapons — try and make a set, by slot or by class of 3–4 weapons. If you can't make the set all strange consider adding a hat.
- Only raffle 1 (ONE) hat, paint, misc or dueling game, at a time, bulk up using odd weapons.

**DO NOT** use **ANY** Unusual items in a raffle!

### Running the raffle

Click *Raffle It* at the bottom of the page and a new window will open. This provides the state of the current raffle, items selected, and a unique link for that raffle via the page’s URL.

Copy and paste the page link (URL) and paste into the in-game text chat so the gamers can open this page in a browser, sign-in via Steam and enter the raffle.

Make sure you announce the new raffle link **clearly** so everyone on the server is aware of the new link.

It helps keeping the current raffles page open until it's done, but if you close it accidentally you can find it again by going to the *My Raffles* link in the top right corner of the page.
